# get-pop
Use php to create people record w/ birth &amp; death, year record, and find year w/ highest population.

Form.php allows you to enter new names into the table people.  This is very simple.  It does not error check for things like the birth year is less than the death year as that was not a requirement.  

pop.php runs through the people table and updates the years table with the population data.  It then determines the year with the highest living population and deliveres a short message.  Once again There is no real handleing of errors or years that tie.
